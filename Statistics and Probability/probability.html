<h2>2. Applying Set Theory to Probability</h2>
<h3>2.1. What is Probability?</h3>
<p>Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the <em>sample space</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sample Space ( \( S \) ):</strong> The set of all possible outcomes. For example, when flipping a coin: <br />\( S = \{\text{Heads, Tails}\} \)</li>
    <li><strong>Event ( \( A \) ):</strong> A subset of the sample space, representing outcomes of interest. For example, \( A \) could be the event of flipping a heads: <br />\( A = \{\text{Heads}\} \)</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of an Event ( \( p \) ):</strong> The probability of a specific event occurring is often denoted by the lowercase letter \( p \). For example, if \( p \) is the probability of flipping heads with a fair coin, then \( p = 0.5 \).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>What are elements in a sample space called?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> In the context of probability theory, elements in a sample space are called <em>outcomes</em> or <em>sample points</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>How do we represent an event that includes multiple outcomes?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> An event that includes multiple outcomes is represented as a subset of the sample space. For example, if \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \) represents the possible outcomes of a die roll, the event \( B \) of rolling an even number could be represented as \( B = \{2, 4, 6\} \).</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>Can the sample space contain events that are not equally likely?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the sample space can contain events that are not equally likely. For instance, if a die is biased, some numbers may be more likely to occur than others, affecting the probability of each outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />Consider rolling a standard six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the sample space \( S \):</strong> \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( A \):</strong> Let \( A \) be the event of rolling a number greater than 4, so \( A = \{5, 6\} \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> The probability of event \( A \) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: \[ P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />A bag contains 7 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 3 yellow balls. What is the probability of drawing a yellow ball?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the total number of balls:</strong> \( |S| = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15 \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( Y \):</strong> Let \( Y \) be the event of drawing a yellow ball, so \( |Y| = 3 \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(Y) = \frac{|Y|}{|S|} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of drawing a yellow ball is \( \frac{1}{5} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />A box contains 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green balls. If you randomly select a ball, what is the probability that it is neither red nor blue?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the total number of balls:</strong> \( |S| = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( G \):</strong> Let \( G \) be the event of drawing a green ball, so \( |G| = 5 \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(G) = \frac{|G|}{|S|} = \frac{5}{12} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that the ball is neither red nor blue is \( \frac{5}{12} \).</p>
<h3>2.2. Probability Function</h3>
<p>The probability function \( P \) assigns a probability to each event in the sample space. This is often denoted as \( P(A) \), where \( A \) is an event.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lowercase \( p \):</strong> As noted earlier, lowercase \( p \) is commonly used to denote the probability of a specific event occurring, especially in situations involving multiple or repetitive trials, such as in the binomial distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the event \( A \) is flipping a heads, and we assume the coin is fair, then: <br />\( P(\text{Heads}) = 0.5 \quad \text{or} \quad p = 0.5 \)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>How does \( P \) fit into the context of a function?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> \( P \) is a function that maps events (which are sets of outcomes) to a number between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the event occurring. So, \( P: \text{Events} \rightarrow [0, 1] \).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>What is the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes in a sample space?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes in a sample space is always 1. This is because one of the outcomes must occur, making the total probability 1.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>Can the probability of an event be greater than 1 or less than 0?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> No, the probability of an event must always be between 0 and 1, inclusive. A probability of 0 means the event cannot occur, while a probability of 1 means the event is certain to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />A jar contains 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green marbles. What is the probability of drawing a green marble?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the total number of marbles:</strong> \( |S| = 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( G \):</strong> Let \( G \) be the event of drawing a green marble, so \( |G| = 10 \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(G) = \frac{|G|}{|S|} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of drawing a green marble is \( \frac{1}{2} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />If a die is rolled, what is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the sample space \( S \):</strong> \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( A \):</strong> Let \( A \) be the event of rolling a number greater than 4, so \( A = \{5, 6\} \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />In a group of 8 people, what is the probability that at least two of them share the same birthday?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the total number of possible outcomes for each person:</strong> \( |S| = 365^8 \) (assuming a non-leap year with 365 days).<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( A \):</strong> Let \( A \) be the event that at least two people share the same birthday.<br />3. <strong>Use the complement rule:</strong> Calculate the probability that no one shares a birthday and subtract from 1. \[ P(\text{no shared birthday}) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \dots \times \frac{358}{365} \] \[ P(A) = 1 - P(\text{no shared birthday}) \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The exact probability would require further computation, but \( P(A) \) gives the probability that at least two people share the same birthday.</p>
<h3>2.3. Probability Rules</h3>
<h4>2.3.1. Addition Rule and Disjoint Events</h4>
<p>The addition rule is used to find the probability that at least one of two events occurs.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Addition Rule:</strong> If \( A \) and \( B \) are two events in a sample space: \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \] If \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint (i.e., mutually exclusive events with no outcomes in common), then: \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>What is the probability of the union of two disjoint events?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> If two events are disjoint, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities. For example, if \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint, then \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>Can the addition rule be used for non-disjoint events?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but you must subtract the probability of the intersection \( P(A \cap B) \) to avoid double-counting the overlap.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>What does it mean for two events to be disjoint?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Two events are disjoint if they have no outcomes in common. For example, in a single roll of a die, the events "rolling a 1" and "rolling a 2" are disjoint.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />What is the probability of drawing a red or black card from a deck of 52 playing cards?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Define the events:</strong> Let \( R \) be the event of drawing a red card and \( B \) be the event of drawing a black card.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( |R| = 26 \) (since there are 26 red cards in the deck).</li>
    <li>\( |B| = 26 \) (since there are 26 black cards in the deck).</li>
    <li>\( |R \cap B| = 0 \) (red and black are disjoint events).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the addition rule:</strong> \[ P(R \cup B) = P(R) + P(B) = \frac{26}{52} + \frac{26}{52} = 1 \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of drawing a red or black card is 1 (since all cards are either red or black).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />If two dice are rolled, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7 or 11?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Define the events:</strong> Let \( A \) be the event of getting a sum of 7, and \( B \) be the event of getting a sum of 11.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( |A| = 6 \) (six combinations give a sum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)).</li>
    <li>\( |B| = 2 \) (two combinations give a sum of 11: (5,6), (6,5)).</li>
    <li>\( |A \cap B| = 0 \) (the events are disjoint).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the addition rule:</strong> \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{6}{36} + \frac{2}{36} = \frac{8}{36} = \frac{2}{9} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of getting a sum of 7 or 11 is \( \frac{2}{9} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />A bag contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. What is the probability of drawing a red or a green marble?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Define the events:</strong> Let \( R \) be the event of drawing a red marble, and \( G \) be the event of drawing a green marble.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( |R| = 4 \)</li>
    <li>\( |G| = 2 \)</li>
    <li>\( |S| = 9 \)</li>
    <li>\( |R \cap G| = 0 \) (the events are disjoint).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the addition rule:</strong> \[ P(R \cup G) = P(R) + P(G) = \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of drawing a red or a green marble is \( \frac{2}{3} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.3.2. Conditional Probability</h4>
<p>Conditional probability measures the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conditional Probability:</strong> The probability of \( A \) occurring given that \( B \) has occurred: \[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \] where \( P(B) &gt; 0 \).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>Why do we need conditional probability?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Conditional probability allows us to update the probability of an event based on new information, specifically the occurrence of another event.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>What happens if \( P(B) = 0 \) in conditional probability?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> If \( P(B) = 0 \), the conditional probability \( P(A | B) \) is undefined because division by zero is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>How does conditional probability relate to the concept of independence?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> If two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other, so \( P(A | B) = P(A) \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />Given that a card drawn from a deck is a king, what is the probability that it is a king of hearts?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>\( K \) is the event of drawing a king.</li>
    <li>\( H \) is the event that the card is the king of hearts.</li>
    <li>\( |K| = 4 \) (4 kings in a deck).</li>
    <li>\( |H \cap K| = 1 \) (only 1 king of hearts).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the conditional probability formula:</strong> \[ P(H | K) = \frac{P(H \cap K)}{P(K)} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{4}{52}} = \frac{1}{4} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that the card is the king of hearts, given that it is a king, is \( \frac{1}{4} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />A bag contains 8 red, 5 green, and 2 blue balls. If a ball is drawn and is known to be red, what is the probability that it is one of the three smallest red balls?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>\( R \) is the event of drawing a red ball.</li>
    <li>\( S \) is the event of drawing one of the three smallest red balls.</li>
    <li>\( |R| = 8 \)</li>
    <li>\( |S \cap R| = 3 \)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the conditional probability formula:</strong> \[ P(S | R) = \frac{P(S \cap R)}{P(R)} = \frac{3/15}{8/15} = \frac{3}{8} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that it is one of the three smallest red balls, given that it is red, is \( \frac{3}{8} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />In a deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing a heart given that the card is red?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>\( R \) is the event of drawing a red card.</li>
    <li>\( H \) is the event of drawing a heart.</li>
    <li>\( |R| = 26 \) (since there are 26 red cards).</li>
    <li>\( |H \cap R| = 13 \) (since all hearts are red).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the conditional probability formula:</strong> \[ P(H | R) = \frac{P(H \cap R)}{P(R)} = \frac{13/52}{26/52} = \frac{13}{26} = \frac{1}{2} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of drawing a heart given that the card is red is \( \frac{1}{2} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.3.3. Multiplication Rule and Independent Events</h4>
<p>The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of the intersection of two events.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multiplication Rule:</strong> For any two events \( A \) and \( B \), the probability of both events occurring is: \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) \times P(B) \]</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Events:</strong> Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if: \[ P(A | B) = P(A) \] Substituting this into the multiplication rule gives: \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>How do you know if two events are independent?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Two events are independent if the probability of one event occurring does not change the probability of the other event. This can be tested using the formula \( P(A | B) = P(A) \).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>What is the difference between independent and disjoint events?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Disjoint events cannot happen at the same time (i.e., they have no outcomes in common), while independent events can occur simultaneously, but the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>Can the multiplication rule be used for dependent events?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but you must use the general multiplication rule \( P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) \times P(B) \), where you account for the dependency by using the conditional probability \( P(A | B) \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />If a die is rolled twice, what is the probability of getting a 6 on both rolls?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong> Let \( A \) be the event of rolling a 6 on the first roll, and \( B \) be the event of rolling a 6 on the second roll. Both events are independent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \)</li>
    <li>\( P(B) = \frac{1}{6} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the multiplication rule for independent events:</strong> \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of getting a 6 on both rolls is \( \frac{1}{36} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />If a coin is flipped three times, what is the probability of getting heads on all three flips?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong> Let \( H_1 \), \( H_2 \), and \( H_3 \) be the events of getting heads on the first, second, and third flips, respectively. All events are independent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)</li>
    <li>\( P(H_2) = \frac{1}{2} \)</li>
    <li>\( P(H_3) = \frac{1}{2} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the multiplication rule for independent events:</strong> \[ P(H_1 \cap H_2 \cap H_3) = P(H_1) \times P(H_2) \times P(H_3) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of getting heads on all three flips is \( \frac{1}{8} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />A card is drawn from a deck, and then another card is drawn without replacement. What is the probability that both cards are aces?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the events:</strong> Let \( A_1 \) be the event of drawing an ace on the first draw, and \( A_2 \) be the event of drawing an ace on the second draw.</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( P(A_1) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \)</li>
    <li>\( P(A_2 | A_1) = \frac{3}{51} \) (since there are now 3 aces left in a deck of 51 cards).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Apply the multiplication rule:</strong> \[ P(A_1 \cap A_2) = P(A_1) \times P(A_2 | A_1) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{3}{663} = \frac{1}{221} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that both cards are aces is \( \frac{1}{221} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2.4. Discrete vs. Continuous Events</h3>
<h4>2.4.1. Discrete Events</h4>
<p>Discrete events are those where the outcomes can be counted, even if infinite (e.g., rolling a die, flipping a coin).</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>What defines a discrete event?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> A discrete event is characterized by a finite or countable set of outcomes. For example, the number of heads in 10 coin flips is a discrete event.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>How does the probability of a discrete event differ from a continuous event?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of a discrete event is the sum of the probabilities of individual outcomes, while the probability of a continuous event involves integrating the probability density function over a range of values.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>Can a discrete event have an infinite number of outcomes?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, a discrete event can have an infinite number of outcomes, such as counting the number of trials until the first success in a geometric distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />What is the probability of rolling a 2 or a 5 on a standard six-sided die?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the sample space \( S \):</strong> \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \)<br />2. <strong>Define the event \( A \):</strong> Let \( A \) be the event of rolling a 2 or a 5, so \( A = \{2, 5\} \).<br />3. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of rolling a 2 or a 5 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />If a die is rolled four times, what is the probability of getting at least one 6?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the sample space \( S \):</strong> For each roll, \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).<br />2. <strong>Use the complement rule:</strong> First, calculate the probability of not getting a 6 in any of the rolls. \[ P(\text{no 6}) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \] Then, subtract this from 1 to find the probability of getting at least one 6. \[ P(\text{at least one 6}) = 1 - P(\text{no 6}) = 1 - \frac{625}{1296} = \frac{671}{1296} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of getting at least one 6 is \( \frac{671}{1296} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 3:</strong><br />In a lottery where you must choose a number between 1 and 100, what is the probability of selecting a number divisible by 10?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the event \( A \):</strong> \( A \) is the event of selecting a number divisible by 10. The numbers divisible by 10 are \( \{10, 20, 30, \dots, 100\} \).</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( |A| = 10 \) (there are 10 numbers divisible by 10 in the range 1 to 100).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability of selecting a number divisible by 10 is \( \frac{1}{10} \).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.4.2. Continuous Events</h4>
<p>Continuous events are those where the outcomes cannot be counted individually, but rather, they form a continuum (e.g., time, temperature).</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>What defines a continuous event?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> A continuous event is characterized by an infinite number of possible outcomes within a given range. For example, the exact time it takes to run a race is a continuous variable.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>How is probability represented in a continuous event?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> In continuous events, probability is represented as the area under the probability density function (PDF) curve within a specific interval.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>Can a continuous event have a probability of zero?</em><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, in continuous distributions, the probability of any single exact outcome (like \( P(X = a) \)) is zero, but the probability of an interval of outcomes (like \( P(a &lt; X &lt; b) \)) is greater than zero.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 1:</strong><br />If the time it takes to complete a task is uniformly distributed between 30 and 60 minutes, what is the probability that the task takes between 40 and 50 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the interval:</strong> The total interval is [30, 60]. The interval of interest is [40, 50].<br />2. <strong>Calculate the probability:</strong> \[ P(40 \leq X \leq 50) = \frac{50 - 40}{60 - 30} = \frac{10}{30} = \frac{1}{3} \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that the task takes between 40 and 50 minutes is \( \frac{1}{3} \).</p>
<p><strong>Sample Exercise 2:</strong><br />The weight of a certain fruit is normally distributed with a mean of 200 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that a randomly selected fruit weighs more than 240 grams?</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />1. <strong>Identify the mean and standard deviation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Mean \( \mu = 200 \)</li>
    <li>Standard deviation \( \sigma = 20 \)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Calculate the z-score:</strong> \[ z = \frac{240 - 200}{20} = 2 \] 3. <strong>Use the z-table to find the probability:</strong> \[ P(Z &gt; 2) = 1 - P(Z &lt; 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228 \] <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that a randomly selected fruit weighs more than 240 grams is 0.0228.</p>
