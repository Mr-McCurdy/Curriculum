    <h2>Factoring by Grouping</h2>
    <p>Factoring by grouping is an algebraic method used to solve quadratic equations, especially when they are part of a larger expression or when direct factoring isn&rsquo;t immediately apparent. This method involves rearranging and grouping the terms of the equation in a way that makes it easier to factor and solve. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to factor quadratics by grouping:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Ensure the Equation is in Standard Form</h3>
    <p>Make sure the quadratic equation is in the standard form:</p>
    <p>\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]</p>
    <p>If it&rsquo;s not, rearrange the terms to get it into this form.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Multiply <em>a</em> and <em>c</em></h3>
    <p>In the standard form equation, multiply the coefficient \( a \) (in front of \( x^2 \)) by the constant term \( c \). This step is crucial for finding a pair of numbers that can be used to split the middle term.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Find Two Numbers</h3>
    <p>You need to find two numbers that multiply together to give the product of \( a \times c \) and add up to \( b \) (the coefficient of the \( x \) term).</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Rewrite the Middle Term</h3>
    <p>Using the two numbers found in Step 3, rewrite the middle term \( bx \) as two terms that can be grouped. Essentially, you&rsquo;re breaking down \( bx \) into two terms whose coefficients sum up to \( b \).</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Group and Factor</h3>
    <p>1. Group the Terms: Divide the quadratic equation into two groups that can each be factored.<br />2. Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF): For each group, factor out the GCF. Ideally, this step will reveal a common factor in each group.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Factor Out the Common Binomial</h3>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve grouped the terms and factored out the GCF from each group, you should have a common binomial factor. Factor this binomial out of each group.</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Solve for <em>x</em></h3>
    <p>After factoring, you will have an equation set equal to zero. Set each factor (now in a much simpler form) equal to zero and solve for \( x \).</p>
    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>Solve the quadratic equation \( 6x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0 \) by factoring by grouping.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Standard Form</strong> The equation is already in standard form.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Multiply <em>a</em> and <em>c</em></strong> <br />\( 6 \times (-6) = -36 \)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Find Two Numbers</strong> <br />We need two numbers that multiply to \( -36 \) and add to \( 5 \). These numbers are \( 9 \) and \( -4 \), because \( 9 \times (-4) = -36 \) and \( 9 + (-4) = 5 \).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: Rewrite the Middle Term</strong> <br />\( 6x^2 + 9x - 4x - 6 = 0 \)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: Group and Factor</strong> <br />Group the terms: \( (6x^2 + 9x) - (4x + 6) = 0 \) <br />Factor out the GCF from each group: \( 3x(2x + 3) - 2(2x + 3) = 0 \)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: Factor Out the Common Binomial</strong> <br />The common binomial factor is \( 2x + 3 \): <br />\( (3x - 2)(2x + 3) = 0 \)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: Solve for <em>x</em></strong> <br />Set each factor equal to zero:<br />\( 3x - 2 = 0 \) leads to \( x = \frac{2}{3} \) <br />\( 2x + 3 = 0 \) leads to \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, the solutions to \( 6x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \).</p>
    <h2>Practice Problem:</h2>
    <p>Try solving \( 3x^2 + 10x + 3 = 0 \) by factoring by grouping.</p>
    <p>Factoring by grouping can initially seem less straightforward for quadratics, as it typically involves an additional step of splitting the middle term. However, it becomes a powerful technique once understood, offering an alternative route to solving quadratic equations, especially when direct factoring isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
