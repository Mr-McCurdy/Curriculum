<h1>Understanding Sampling Distributions</h1>

<hr style="border: 0; height: 2px; background-color: #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In statistics, understanding how sample data behaves in relation to the population it comes from is essential. A key tool to achieve this is the concept of a sampling distribution. A sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a given statistic based on a random sample. When we calculate statistics like the sample mean or sample proportion, they vary from sample to sample. The distribution of these statistics forms what we call a <i>sampling distribution</i>.
</p>
<p>
To fully grasp this concept, we also need to understand the distinction between <b>parameters</b> and <b>statistics</b>. A parameter refers to a number that describes the entire population (for example, population mean \( \mu \) or population proportion \( p \)). A statistic, on the other hand, refers to a number calculated from a sample, such as the sample mean \( \bar{x} \) or sample proportion \( \hat{p} \). Statistics are used to estimate parameters.

<h2>Sampling Distributions for Proportions and Means</h2>

<p>We deal with sampling distributions for both proportions and means in AP Statistics, and understanding both is vital for making inferences about populations from sample data. Below, we'll explore each type.</p>

<h3>1. Sampling Distribution for Sample Proportions</h3>

<p>For a categorical variable, we often calculate the sample proportion \( \hat{p} \). The sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) provides the distribution of the sample proportions for all possible random samples of a given size from a population with proportion \( p \). The sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mean of the sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) is \( \mu_{\hat{p}} = p \).</li>
    <li>Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) is \( \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} \), where \( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    <li>The shape of the distribution is approximately normal if the sample size is large enough. Specifically, if \( np \geq 10 \) and \( n(1 - p) \geq 10 \), the sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) can be modeled by a normal distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Sampling Distribution for Sample Means</h3>

<p>For numerical data, the sample mean \( \bar{x} \) is of interest. The sampling distribution of \( \bar{x} \) gives the distribution of the sample means for all possible random samples of a given size from a population with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \). The characteristics of the sampling distribution for the sample mean are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mean of the sampling distribution of \( \bar{x} \) is \( \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu \).</li>
    <li>Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \( \bar{x} \) is \( \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \), where \( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    <li>According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), if the population distribution is not normal, the sampling distribution of \( \bar{x} \) will be approximately normal if the sample size is sufficiently large (usually \( n \geq 30 \)).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Worked Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1: Sampling Distribution for Proportions</h3>
<p>
    Suppose a population has a proportion \( p = 0.4 \) who prefer a particular brand. If we take a random sample of size 100, what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \)?
</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b><br>
    The mean of the sampling distribution of \( \hat{p} \) is \( \mu_{\hat{p}} = 0.4 \).<br>
    The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is:
    \[
    \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.4(1 - 0.4)}{100}} = 0.049
    \]
</p>

<h3>Example 2: Sampling Distribution for Means</h3>
<p>
    Suppose the mean height of all adult women is \( \mu = 64 \) inches with a standard deviation \( \sigma = 3 \) inches. If we take a random sample of 50 women, what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean height \( \bar{x} \)?
</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b><br>
    The mean of the sampling distribution of \( \bar{x} \) is \( \mu_{\bar{x}} = 64 \).<br>
    The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is:
    \[
    \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{50}} \approx 0.424
    \]
